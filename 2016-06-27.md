### App Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource load since it is insecure. Temporary exceptions can be configured via your app's Info.plist file.

### The unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions
>occurs when you try and display a new viewcontroller before the current view controller is finished displaying. You can reproduce it by navigating in viewWillAppear.

>Basically you are trying to push two view controllers onto the stack at almost the same time. Suggest you maintain a queue in the tableview controller which maintains a list of the detail views which need displaying. Push one at a time on to the stack and check on exit from the current detail view whether there are any queued detail views which need displaying.

>This kind of navigation is going to be confusing for the user. It may be better to consider making your detail view support multiple items.
